# docker

Automate loading `default` docker-machine environment and add missing tab completion for Fish Shell.

By default, developer always call `eval (docker-machine env default)` during open a new terminal window(tab),
this plugins will automate call the command that you can use `docker` command in anywhere. of cause, here is
a variable to set to change default machine name:

```fish
# File: ~/.config/fish/config.fish

set -gx DOCKER_DEFAULT_MACHINE "dev"

# Load fisher/omf init script
```

Tab completion just added basic subcommand description. enjoy it.

Works for [Fisherman][Fisherman-link]/[Oh My Fish][omf-link].
